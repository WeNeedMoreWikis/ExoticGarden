    <h1>Plants and Fruits</h1>
    <p>Plants and Fruits are broken up into various categories depending upon what the Plant looks like when it's ready to be harvested.<br>
      All plants when initially planted, and when not ready for harvesting (with the exception of trees), are oak saplings, which can make differentiating hard.<br>
      The 4 categories of Plants are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bushes - Single Leaf Blocks</li>
      <li>Plants - A Single Fruit</li>
      <li>Vines - A Fruit on top of a Leaf Block</li>
      <li>Trees - A Full Tree, with multiple Fruit growing from it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Bushes, Plants, and Vines, are all "single-use". When you right click on the Fruit or Leaf Block, they will return to Sapling Forn and drop 1 Fruit.<br>
      Trees, however, drop Fruit when the Fruit is directly clicked, in which case it will re-grow after a period, or when the tree is cut down. Fruit trees when cut will drop multiple sapplings, making them the only plants that can be directly duplicated.</p>
